        Today's style of nigirizushi (握り寿司, "hand-pressed sushi"),
        consisting of an oblong mound of rice with a slice of fish draped over
        it, became popular in

        (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of the
        origin of nigirizushi is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who
        invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku. The
        nigirizushi of this period was somewhat different from modern
        nigirizushi. The sushi rice of this period was about three times the
        size of today's nigirizushi. The amount of vinegar used was half that of
        today's sushi, and the type of vinegar developed during this period,
        called aka-su (赤酢, "red vinegar"), was made by fermenting sake lees.
        They also used slightly more salt than in modern times instead of sugar.

        The ingredients used inside sushi are called gu and are, typically,
        varieties of fish. For culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the
        minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior
        to that of fish that is to be cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to
        recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and
        freedom from parasites that may go undetected in a commercial
        inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (maguro, shiro-maguro), Japanese
        amberjack, yellowtail (hamachi), snapper (kurodai), mackerel (saba), and
        salmon (sake). The most valued sushi ingredient is toro, the fatty cut
        of the fish. This comes in a variety of ōtoro (often from the bluefin
        species of tuna) and chūtoro, meaning "middle toro", implying that it is
        halfway into the fattiness between toro and the regular cut. Aburi style
        refers to nigiri sushi, where the fish is partially grilled (topside)
        and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw toppings,
        called neta.
