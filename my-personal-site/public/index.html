      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <h1>Julie Laursen</h1>
    <p>I'm a senior automation engineer with experience implementing various front-end and back-end test frameworks in multiple programming languages for cross functional distributed teams in companies from startup to enterprise level.
     I test holistically from the component and API level to end-to-end functional testing. I focus on UX best practices and accessibility. I aim to enhance the maintainability and reduce technical debt of the system under test, maintaining a resilient test architecture while analyzing the artifacts of our test tooling to make or suggest improvements in the codebase. 
    </p>
    <p>
     For the past ten years, I have helped facilitate local STEM engagement by curating communities of practice. I volunteer for nonprofits and advocacy organizations that help enhance the quality of life for Austinites as well as dedicating time to community engagement through local meetup and conference organization in the tech space.</p>
