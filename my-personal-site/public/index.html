      <p class="about-me">I'm a senior automation engineer with experience implementing various front-end and back-end test frameworks in multiple programming languages.
        I'm also a student at Austin Community College in the UX/UI program. I focus on UX best practices and accessibility and I do volunteer work auditing websites for compliance with WCAG guidelines as well as usability.

    <p>
     For the past ten years, I have helped facilitate local STEM engagement by curating communities in the meetup and tech conference space. I do social media marketing for DevOpsDays Austin. In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking and working out.</p>

    <h2>My Favorite Things</h2>
    <h3 id="favorite-movie">My favorite movie</h3>
    <p> I really like <strong>Encounters at the End of the World</strong> by Werner Herzog. I like anything Werner Herzog (or making fun of Werner Herzog- Documentary Now was a great tribute). This one is a wildlife documentary so there is no starring actor, but he does use <em>Klaus Kinski</em> in a lot of his movies.</em></p>
    <h3 id="favorite-foods">My Favorite Foods</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../competancy2/favorite-food.html">Sushi</a></li>
      <li>Hot wings</li>
      <li>Snow crab</li>
    </ul>
