      <p>I'm a senior automation engineer with experience implementing various front-end and back-end test frameworks in multiple programming languages.
        I'm also a student at Austin Community College in the UX/UI program. I focus on UX best practices and accessibility and I do volunteer work auditing websites for compliance with WCAG guidelines as well as usability.

     For the past ten years, I have helped facilitate local STEM engagement by curating communities in the meetup and tech conference space. I do social media marketing for DevOpsDays Austin. In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking and working out.</p>

    <h3>My favorite movie</h3>
    <p> I really like <strong>Encounters at the End of the World</strong> by Werner Herzog. I like anything Werner Herzog (or making fun of Werner Herzog- Documentary Now was a great tribute). This one is a wildlife documentary so there is no starring actor, but he does use <em>Klaus Kinski</em> in a lot of his movies.</em></p>
